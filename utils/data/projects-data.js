        description: 'I developed a Proxy Management Dashboard aimed at streamlining both user and admin tasks related to proxy management and oversight. The frontend architecture was realized through React, chosen for its dynamic UI capabilities and flexible state management, while being complemented by Tailwind CSS for its contemporary and responsive design ethos. The backend infrastructure leverages Node.js and Express, a combination that guarantees robust API functionality alongside secure authentication mechanisms. To accommodate diverse user requirements, the system was designed to support multiple user roles, each with distinct access privileges. A crucial aspect of the platform is the integration of Stripe for payment processing, enabling straightforward and secure transactions for proxy services. MongoDB was employed for its adept data handling capabilities, ensuring the systems responsiveness and scalability.',
